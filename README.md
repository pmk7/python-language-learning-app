1. Install Python: If you don't have Python installed on your machine, download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation.

2. Obtain a personal API key from OpenAI: Visit the following link to get your API key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

3. Install the OpenAI Python package: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the OpenAI package:

sudo pip3 install openai

3. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable on your system:

For macOS or Linux: Run the following command in your terminal, replacing "your_api_key" with the actual API key:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"

For Windows: Run the following command in your Command Prompt or PowerShell, replacing "your_api_key" with the actual API key:

setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key"

Note that you might need to restart your terminal, command prompt, or IDE for the environment variable to take effect.

4. Clone the project: Clone the project repository from GitHub or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.

5. Open the project folder: Navigate to the folder where you've cloned or extracted the project files in your terminal or command prompt.
   Run the Python script: In your terminal or command prompt, run the following command to start the Python script:

python3 main.py

Now you should be able to use the sentence generator with the OpenAI package. These instructions provide more detailed steps that should be accessible to users with no coding experience.
